# Spirographs

Just a little boy webpage to see some neat spirographs. 
Try it out at: https://hporro.github.io/Spirographs/

## Checking out different spirographs

Now you can't change the parameters of the spirograph drawn on the webpage, but you can download the project and change the numbers on `main.js` in order to do it. As the project is javascript only it should run on any web browser without any prerequisites.
